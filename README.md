# Canadian-House-Prices-for-Top-Cities
House prices in major Canadian cities showed substantial differences and raised important issues for policymakers and researchers. Analyzing the distribution and trends of house prices among these cities is vital for understanding economic policies, housing affordability, and wealth disparities. Policymakers strive to maintain a stable housing market while addressing affordability concerns to promote inclusive urban development and ensure fair access to housing for all.
# Key Questions
•	What is the average house price across all provinces? How do average house prices vary by province?

•	How do house prices differ based on the number of bedrooms and bathrooms?

•	Does population density play a role in the house prices of each province?

•	Does median family income have any effect on the housing market prices?

•	What privacy laws need to be adhered to when collecting, storing, and analyzing housing market data?

# Data
